            "answer": "<p>The duration of wearing a VR headset is normally less than 5 minutes within each session. Children wear a headset to look at the world they created on a computer.</p><p style='margin-top: 1rem;'>One of the biggest concerns is the impact VR tech could have on kids' eyes. Parents have long told children that staring at a screen will make their eyes go square, but the American Academy of Ophthalmology says there is no evidence that long exposure to screens can cause permanent damage.</p>"
